![alt text](https://github.com/Ali-Hasan-Khan/Scrape-Whoscored-Event-Data/blob/main/logo.jpg "Whoscored")

Now you can get **FREE!!** match event data from [Whoscored](http://whoscored.com/ "Whoscored")'s chalkboard using **Selenium**. 

Follow these steps after downloading the code:
1) Requirements: 
    - `Selenium==3.141.0` (Web scraping tool, [docs](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/))
    - `mplsoccer==1.0.2` (Amazing python library for drawing soccer/football pitches with matplotlilb, [docs](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

2) For some additional visual customisations replace **linecollection.py** with the one present in mplsoccer folder on your machine (somewhere here: ~\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\mplsoccer). [**Recommended**] 
  
3) Follow **tutorial.py/tutorial.ipynb** for a guide.

4) Make sure **chromedriver.exe**(89) matches with your version of chrome.(otherwise install that version)
