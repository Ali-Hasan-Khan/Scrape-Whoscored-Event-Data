![alt text](https://github.com/Ali-Hasan-Khan/Scrape-Whoscored-Event-Data/blob/main/logo.jpg "Whoscored")

Now you can get **free** match event data from [Whoscored](http://whoscored.com/ "Whoscored")'s chalkboard using **Selenium**. 

Follow these steps after downloading the code:
1) Packages to install: [**Required**]
    - [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) (Web scraping tool)
    - [mplsoccer](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Amazing python library for drawing soccer/football pitches in Matplotlib)

2) For some manually added features and fixes replace **pitch.py** with the one present in mplsoccer folder on your machine (somewhere here: C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\mplsoccer). [**Recommended**] 
  
3) Follow **tutorial.py/tutorial.ipynb** for a quick overview.
